# Hello world

This is the FRC 2018 Power Up Chaos Theory code. Due to the nature of the robot, and the nature of autonomous, several changes have been made to the structure of the project, as opposed to previous years. In short, actuation is done via Actions, and these Actions are run via subsequences, which are run by a master sequence in Autonomous. The commands are iterative/linear based and the sequences of actions can run simultaneously. These actions are predefined, and can be strung together in series, or in complicated webs of logic enabled greater autonomous complexity.
